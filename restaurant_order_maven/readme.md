Situation
You've just been hired as a Data Analyst for the Taste of the World Cafe, a restaurant that has diverse menu offerings and serve generous portions

The Assignment 
The Taste of the World Cafe debuted a new menu at the start of the year.
You've been asked to dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top
customers seem to like best

The Objectives
1. Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu.
2. Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that's been collected.
3. Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu.

Recommended Analysis

1. What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
2. What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?
3. Were there certain times that had more or less orders?
4. Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data
